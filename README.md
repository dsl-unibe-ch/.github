***Data issues? Who you gonna call?***

Launched in March 2023, the Data Science Lab (DSL) of the University of Bern provides university-wide support for researchers and research groups in data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and research IT related matters. 

Nodegoat Support, previously provided by the Digital Humanities, is now integrated into the DSL. 

The support ranges from instant help desk answers and custom code or algorithm development to long-term collaborations on infrastructures and research projects with co-analysis and co-authoring.
